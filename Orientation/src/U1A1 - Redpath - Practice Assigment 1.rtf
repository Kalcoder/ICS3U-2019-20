Hello, I am Kaleb Redpath, a grade ten student at Bowmanville High School, and these are my favourite hobbies. I love to program, and I also love making games. I am also in my school's concert and jazz bands, and I really enjoy playing the trumpet. I have been programming various things for about five years, and have played the trumpet for four years.
