Hello, I am Kaleb Redpath, a grade ten student at Bowmanville High School, and these are my favourite hobbies. I love to program, and I also love making games. I am also in my school's concert and jazz bands, and I really enjoy playing the trumpet. I have been programming various things for about five years, and have played the trumpet for four years. I am very interested in Java development, so when I saw that we are learning Java in this course, I was ecstatic to say the least. I cannot wait to start and get into the depths of the course!
